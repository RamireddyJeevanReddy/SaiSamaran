        <h1>Thursday Special</h1>
        <p>Along with all the aati's we will have special Pallaki Seva after Dhoop aarti.The Sai Baba Pallaki Seva, a
            cherished tradition in the worship of Sai Baba at Sai Smaran, is a grand procession that carries the divine
            presence of Sai Baba through the streets, symbolizing His benevolence and accessibility to all. This sacred
            ceremony occurs with great reverence and devotion, uniting devotees in a joyous celebration of their beloved
            deity.

            The Pallaki Seva commences with the preparations of the beautifully adorned palanquin, or "pallaki," that
            carries the idol or image of Sai Baba. Devotees lovingly decorate the pallaki with fragrant flowers,
            colorful draperies, and intricate designs, infusing it with a sense of grandeur and devotion. The rhythmic
            beats of drums, the melodious tunes of devotional songs, and the resonance of conch shells mark the
            beginning of this auspicious event.

            Devotees from all walks of life gather in great numbers, eager to participate in the procession. They take
            turns carrying the pallaki on their shoulders, a privilege that fills their hearts with profound joy and
            spiritual fulfillment. As the procession moves through the streets, devotees sing bhajans and chant mantras
            dedicated to Sai Baba, spreading His divine blessings and teachings to all who witness the procession.The
            Pallaki Seva serves as a powerful symbol of Sai Baba's universal presence and His message of love,
            compassion, and unity. It reinforces the idea that Sai Baba transcends boundaries and is accessible to all,
            regardless of caste, creed, or social status. The devotion and togetherness experienced during this ceremony
            create a sense of community and reinforce the spiritual bond shared among Sai Baba's devotees.

            Beyond its religious significance, the Pallaki Seva is a vibrant celebration of Sai Baba's teachings and His
            profound impact on the lives of those who follow His path. It is a beautiful expression of devotion and a
            reminder that Sai Baba's divine grace is ever-present and accessible to all who seek His blessings.</p>
